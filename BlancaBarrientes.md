# Markdown File Reflection

# What I Learned
* GitHub has a Docs section that explains features in detail, along with simple step-by-step instructions.
* I understood GitHub as a space for saving work and collaboration.
* In my current role, we use SharePoint, which feels similar since it allows creating different verions, reverting when needed, and collaboration.
* I liked seeing that GitHub supports version control. Unlike my past coding experience where I had to start over, here I can roll back to older versions.
* I also like that it's cloud based, but still allows me to clone reporsitories and save copies locally if needed.

# What I'm Still Confused About
* The difference between branches and forks.
* When to commit directly to the main branch versus creating a new branch.
* How issues are meant to be used in practice.
* As I continue to use GitHub, I hope to gain a better overall understanding of the system and eventually integrate it into my day-to-day as I grow my coding skills.

#Video Confirmation
* I watched the intro video. While at times I was a bit confused because it switched from Git to GitHub, I got the general gist of the main idea of how GitHub works.
